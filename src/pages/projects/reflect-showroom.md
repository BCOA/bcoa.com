BC-OA was asked to design a showroom in Soho to present a new architectural surfaces product. The showroom is meant to demonstrate the versatility of a lightweight modular glass panel system containing static graphics, LED illumination and active displays. The space is divided into two zones - a simulated entry lobby with elevator both clad with the modular product followed by an open convention area for rotating exhibits, meetings, demonstrations and educational workshops.
