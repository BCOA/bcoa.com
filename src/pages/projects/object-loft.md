This double-wide SoHo Loft building has uniquely wide dimensions, allowing for broad views from front to back of this approximately 2500sf residence. Three volumetric objects are strategically placed within the public space, providing a staggered canvas of living utilities – kitchen, storage, entry - within the otherwise pure geometry of the floor plan. Placement of the objects straddles the original line of cast iron columns, generating a visual contrast of new against old from front to back of the apartment. The center room at the apartment rear is enclosed by a glass and raw steel framed wall, allowing daylight from the oversized windows to flood in from both orientations of the apartment.


In reference to the industrial past of this iconic cast-iron loft building, the three objects are built of a bespoke raw steel frame system and clad in rusted perforated steel panels – some operable, others fixed. The remaining materials of the apartment provide a raw, minimalist palette – exposed brick, wide plank rustic oak floor boards and cast concrete.
