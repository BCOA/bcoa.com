The concept for this complex was driven by the “City of Romance” label for the city as well as the connection of the site to the water. A series of organic interconnected buildings join together to form vibrant multi-leveled urban spaces. The necessity for a very large orthogonal exhibition space is contrary to the master plan form, yet the design of the Exhibition center succeeds in acting as the backdrop to the seamless ribbon convention center which wraps around enclosed and open spaces throughout the development and water’s edge. The Exhibition Center accommodates approximately 500,000 sq ft of interior sky lit exhibition space supported by ancillary exterior gardens and the critical back of house support spaces.

Luigi Ciaccia was Senior Designer on the exhibition center through the Design Development phase of the project. This role required the coordination of the exhibition facility with the master plan, while leading a team of 4 on the detailed design development, exterior envelope and interior planning of the project.
