The concept for this complex was driven by the “City of
 Romance” label for the city as well as the connection of the
 site to the water. A series of organic interconnected buildings
 join together to form vibrant multi-leveled urban spaces. The
 necessity for a very large orthogonal exhibition space is contrary
 to the master plan form, yet the design of the Exhibition
 center succeeds in acting as the backdrop to the seamless
 ribbon convention center which wraps around enclosed and
 open spaces throughout the development and water’s edge.
 The Exhibition Center accommodates approximately 500,000
 sq ft of interior sky lit exhibition space supported by ancillary
 exterior gardens and the critical back of house support
 spaces.

Luigi Ciaccia was Senior Designer on the exhibition center
 through the Design Development phase of the project. This
 role required the coordination of the exhibition facility with
 the master plan, while leading a team of 4 on the detailed
 design development, exterior envelope and interior planning
 of the project.
