This 2300sf loft located on Soho’s quintessential Crosby Street offers ample square lfootage in a long and narrow floor plan. A partial wall dividing the public and private spaces of this residence breaks the floor plan in half, providing a friendlier proportion for the open kitchen, dining and living space, while still permitting views straight through the apartment to windows at the two extremes. The original loft materials - brick and heavy timber columns - are exposed throughout the living and dining area, with contemporary insertions to provide a comfortable kitchen and sitting area. Furniture selection by Tamara Eaton Design.
