Stair-Well Housing represents a concept for modular housing
 design intended to address NYCs dire need to bring low
 cost, efficient affordable housing to the five boroughs. The
 flexible, stacking design is conceived to take advantage of
 the many vacant infill lots located in developing, low-rise
 neighborhoods in the 5 boroughs. The invention is in the
 single stair run integrated into each module which, when
 stacked, provides continuous access to the unit above and
 integrates egress pathways.

The inclusion of private interior and exterior spaces
 and the use of the sun-filled common stairwell as the
 heart of the shared community spaces help Stair-Well Housing
 marry efficient and adaptable modular construction techniques
 with the power of design, bringing dignity and joy to
 its residents.
