Stair-Well Housing represents a concept for modular housing design intended to address NYCs dire need to bring low cost, eff icient aff ordable housing to the fi ve boroughs. The flexible, stacking design is conceived to take advantage of the many vacant infi ll lots located in developing, low-rise neighborhoods in the 5 boroughs. The invention is in the single stair run integrated into each module which, when stacked, provides continuous access to the unit above and integrates egress pathways.

Through the integration of private interior and exterior spaces and the use of the sun-fi lled common stairwell as the heart of the shared community spaces, Stair-Well Housing marries eff icient and adaptable modular construction techniques with the power of design, bringing dignity and joy to its residents.
