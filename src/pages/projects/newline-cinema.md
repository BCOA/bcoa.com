The building at 116 North Robertson Boulevard, designed in the 1950’s in Los Angeles, prefi gured Caesar Pelli’s “Blue Whale” as a Design Center for Architects and Decorators. Its thick, buff brick and stone exterior and narrow slit windows permit only a minimum of daylight in the interest of material preservation and protection. SM+H was challenged to introduce daylight throughout a space both unsuitable for fi lm production and undesirable for occupation.

Continuous “broken” glass clerestories with deliberate partition off sets, together with a sheared and overlapped acoustic tile ceiling modulate the mundane perimeter and ceiling of a relentless real estate model, the “off ice” building. Partition tops are capped and reinforced with apple-ply plates, that in turn serve as jambs and bucks. Building systems and materials formerly rendered normative are re-presented in a seemingly chaotic manner, a reflection of the ethos of New Line Cinema, the New York based “renegade” fi lm company. Bronwyn Breitner led a team of 3 people at SMH as senior designer and project manager on this gut renovation.
