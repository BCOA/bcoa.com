The building at 116 North Robertson Boulevard, designed
 in the 1950’s in Los Angeles, prefi gured Caesar Pelli’s “Blue
 Whale” as a Design Center for Architects and Decorators. Its
 thick, buff brick and stone exterior and narrow slit windows
 permit only a minimum of daylight in the interest of material
 preservation and protection. SM+H was challenged to introduce
 daylight throughout a space both unsuitable for fi lm
 production and undesirable for occupation.

Continuous “broken” glass clerestories with deliberate partition
 off sets, together with a sheared and overlapped acoustic
 tile ceiling modulate the mundane perimeter and ceiling
 of a relentless real estate model, the “off ice” building.
 Partition tops are capped and reinforced with apple-ply
 plates, that in turn serve as jambs and bucks. Building systems
 and materials formerly rendered normative are re-presented
 in a seemingly chaotic manner, a reflection of the
 ethos of New Line Cinema, the New York based “renegade”
 fi lm company.
 Bronwyn Breitner led a team of 3 people at SMH as senior
 designer and project manager on this gut renovation.
