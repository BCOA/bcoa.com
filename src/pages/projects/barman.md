This young family was looking to renovate their 1950's California bungalow to open up the floor plan and modernize the interior. 590BC responded by opening up the common space, and exposing the existing roof vault across the common space, creating an expansive and spacious interior flooded with light from new skylights and sliding glass doors. Also, Rainbow Garage Office!
