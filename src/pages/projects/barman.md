This young family was looking to renovate their 1950's California bungalow to open up the floor plan and modernize the interior. BCâ€”OA responded ripping out a dropped ceiling and attic space over the kitchen and living space, exposing the existing roof vault across the common space, creating an expansive and spacious interior flooded with light from new skylights and sliding glass doors. Also, Rainbow Garage Office!
