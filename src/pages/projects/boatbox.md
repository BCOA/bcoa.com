BC-OA was selected to participate in desigNYC 2011 and was paired with PortSide NewYork to plan and design a kayak storage container in Valentino Park in Red Hook, Brooklyn. An existing reclaimed shipping container is currently located on the sidewalk outside of the park. Through a series of site studies we determined the optimal site for the container to maximize visibility without interrupting views to the East River, and to frame a courtyard in a forgotten corner of the park. The exterior of the container is to be used for maritime related interpretive graphic exhibitry curated by PortSide. A green roof on the container itself protects the contents of the box. Reclaimed flotsam are secured as benches around the site and a perforated metal shade structure creates a protected destination.
