This double-wide SoHo Loft building has uniquely wide
 dimensions, allowing for broad views from front to back of
 this approximately 2500sf residence. Three volumetric objects
 are strategically placed within the public space, providing
 a staggered canvas of living utilities – kitchen, storage,
 entry - within the otherwise pure geometry of the floor plan.
 Placement of the objects straddles the original line of cast
 iron columns, generating a visual contrast of new against old
 from front to back of the apartment. The center room at the
 apartment rear is enclosed by a glass and raw steel framed
 wall, allowing daylight from the oversized windows to flood in
 from both orientations of the apartment.
 

In reference to the industrial past of this iconic cast-iron loft
 building, the three objects are built of a bespoke raw steel
 frame system and clad in rusted perforated steel panels –
 some operable, others fixed. The remaining materials of the
 apartment provide a raw, minimalist palette – exposed brick,
 wide plank rustic oak floor boards and cast concrete.
