The design of this project revolves around glass and light - decorative and functional, natural and synthetic. The clients are avid glass art collectors, with an extensive collection of colorful, fluid glass art sculptures that would be on display throughout the space. Simultaneously they are interested in innovations in glass technologies, and came to 590BC because of our experimentation with the integration of glass and LED light panels into our designs. We responded in collaboration with them by designing a minimalist white and neutral space that would act as a backdrop for the artwork. Custom designed LED light panels integrate into the architecture and guide you through the space, creating a distinct and even wash of light and acting as light and glass sculptures themselves.
