The Wintergarden Is a cafe/ event space situated at the center the Alexandria Center for Science and Technology at the East River Science Park in Manhattan. BC-OAs founding principal, Luigi Ciaccia, acted as senior architect for this project at RMJM. The cafe space is conceptualized as the peeling-up of the surrounding plaza to create an enclosed space for cafe life and formal events. The space offers panoramic views of the surroundings using a point supported, floor-to-ceiling glass enclosure, and provides a quiet space for reflection at this remote edge of the city.
