The site for this vacation residence is a sloped and densely wooded lot on Jungle Lake in Wisconsin. The design responds to the form of the existing cabin on site by creating two unequal gabled roof lines. The taller of the two bars faces the lake, allowing sweeping views from a lofted second floor. The overall form is conceived of as carving away a minimal rustic cabin to reveal a modern glass and metal structure. Both the renovated existing cabin and the new structure consist of two shifted bars that house dual living / kitchen / dining while framing an outdoor courtyard accessible from each structure. Full height sliding glass doors maximize views and open up to the outdoors, blurring the division between the semi-public outdoors and private interiors.
