This gut renovation of a Brooklyn townhouse converted the property from a 3 family to a single family residence. The scope of work included reconfiguring the floors to allow for a parlor floor separating two bedroom floors. The intermediate bracing wall was removed in order to open up the parlor level entirely, making the space feel brighter and more open. Other work included a new roof, new hot water heat system and mini split air conditioning, replacement of 50% of the existing wood joists, new floors, new bathrooms and kitchen and an exterior stair.
