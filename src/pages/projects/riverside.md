The 151st street Kiosk is a free-standing, open-air kiosk and
 bar at the existing circular lookout point at Riverside Drive,
 the site of a masonry pagoda demolished in the 60’s.

Views from this unique urban vantage point span from the
 Jersey skyline to landmark views of the George Washington
 Bridge. The kiosk’s V-shaped columns and double-chord roof
 with triangulated truss structure take their cues from the two
 triangulated steel towers that represent that NYC icon.
 The kiosk structure, however is built from cross-laminated
 timbers treated to withstand the elements. The material
 warmth together with the open views through the kiosk are
 intended to reflect a structure that is welcoming and inclusive
 of all.
