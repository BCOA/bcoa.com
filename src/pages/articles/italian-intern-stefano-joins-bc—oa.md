Stefano Grisoglio has joined the BC—OA team. Stefano comes directly from Ivrea, Italy and recently graduated from the Polytechnic University of Turin. His Thesis titled SPACE explores the use of immersive Virtual Reality as a tool to study how humans move through spaces and how it feels to be inside something that is not built. We're hoping to bring this tool and thinking to our next projects. Stay tuned!
