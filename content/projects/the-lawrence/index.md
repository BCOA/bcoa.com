BC—OA was contracted to act as design architects late in the project development of this 2 building, 7 story ground-up development in Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn. The massing for the two back-to-back buildings was fixed, but the interior design and details of the facade had not been considered. Working within those limits we introduced exposed steel detailing within a new brick coursework design which integrates into a redesigned balcony. Pops of color, plant screens and wood help to bring some contemporary materials and detailing to what was a monolithic expanse of brick. The interiors are designed to appeal to the new young tenants who will occupy these 1 br apartments, with a contemporary industrial feel.
