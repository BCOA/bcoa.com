This corner loft situated at the outer Soho limits is small in footprint but has the advantage of corner, wrap-around windows to expand the city views and flood the unit with natural light. Exposed brick throughout the unit and original tin ceiling keep the loft attitude of the building. A refined walnut island with an infinity-edge concrete countertop introduces a modern showpiece into the raw space. New surfaces trace the edges of the private zone, reading as overlapping planes within the industrial box.
