Stair-Well Housing represents a concept for modular housing
design intended to address NYCs dire need to bring low
cost, efficient affordable housing to the five boroughs. The
flexible, stacking design is designed to take advantage of
the many vacant infill lots located in developing, low-rise
neighborhoods in the 5 boroughs. The invention is in the
single stair run integrated into each module which, when
stacked, provides continuous access to the unit above and
integrates egress pathways.

The inclusion of private interior and exterior spaces
and the use of the sun-filled common stairwell as the
heart of the shared community spaces help Stair-Well Housing
marry efficient and adaptable modular construction techniques
with the power of design, bringing dignity and joy to
its residents.
