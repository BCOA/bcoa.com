The 151st street Kiosk is a free-standing, open-air kiosk and
bar at the existing circular lookout point at Riverside Drive,
the site of a masonry pagoda demolished in the 60’s.

Views from this unique urban vantage point span from the
Jersey skyline to landmark views of the George Washington
Bridge. The kiosk’s V-shaped columns and double-chord roof
with triangulated truss structure take their cues from the two
triangulated steel towers that represent that NYC icon.
The kiosk structure, however is built from cross-laminated
timbers treated to withstand the elements. The material
warmth together with the open views through the kiosk are
intended to reflect a structure that is welcoming and inclusive
of all.

Beneath the kiosk, hovering at a level between the highway and riverside drive, exist an abandoned arcade and rotunda structure, formally used as comfort stations and an electrical transfer hub respectively. These elegant structures, designed and built for utterly utilitarian programs, reflect the sensitivity and quality of old New York, built by hand to last a lifetime. After nearly 60 years with their doors literally cemented shut, the NYC parks department has invited Harlem Public to re-activate these structures as concessionaires. BC—OA is excited to participate in such an important, public works project. More updates to come....
