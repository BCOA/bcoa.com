LIFT Next Level Floats is a boutique sensory deprivation spa, the first dedicated spa of its kind in NYC. The program consists of private soundproof and lightproof float rooms, each which contain a heavily salinated warm water tank for floating. The experience results in a deep state of relaxation and a heightened sense of perception. Upon exiting the private rooms, the users enter the decompression lounge which allows for a gentle transition back into daily stimuli. BC—OA introduces a material palette of fir plywood, reclaimed steel and industrial grade wool felt to respond to the existing brick perimeter walls and concrete floors. These rich and natural materials produce a diverse and tactile palette which invites the touch.

Lift received an Award of Merit from the 2016 AIA Brooklyn + Queens Design Awards.
