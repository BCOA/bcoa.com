Disco Wall is an in-progress HVAC systems upgrade and mechanical enclosure project for the Brooklyn Children’s Museum (BCM), a cultural institution layered with architectural histories and environmental ambition.

The museum’s geothermal HVAC system—an early sustainability initiative—has suffered long-term performance failures due to sediment intrusion and equipment fouling. The result has been inconsistent interior conditions, seasonal space closures, and risk to BCM’s collections.

Working with DDC and co-sponsors DCLA and DCAS, the project replaces the compromised system with a highly efficient, all-electric mechanical strategy utilizing five air-source heat pumps. The new system eliminates fossil fuel dependence for heating and cooling while meeting energy reduction requirements tied to a DCAS Energy Grant.

Because the units must be located in a highly visible rooftop position adjacent to Rafael Viñoly’s yellow addition and Toshiko Mori’s rooftop pavilion, the enclosure became an architectural opportunity.

The proposed wind-driven “kineticwall” screen transforms necessary infrastructure into a responsive, playful façade. Composed of individually pinned aluminum plates, the system animates with shifting wind conditions—creating a fluid, pixelated surface that aligns with BCM’s mission to ignite curiosity, celebrate identity, and cultivate joyful learning.
